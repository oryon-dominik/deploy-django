## Idea deployment API

### external service

- e.g github-action or local script -> pushes deployment over the API
- saves the secret-token to answer the challenge/response

### django project

the project to deploy

- implements our reusable app as module
- gives an endpoint, e.g. /deploy-hash/
- generate a "secret-token" for the challenge/response
    
    import secrets
    secrets.hex(32)

## external service

GET /deploy/ -> get a "challenge" back (e.g a random number/string)

The response will get generated with "auth token" and "challenge" (e.g.: SHA(challenge + secret))

The external service does a POST to /deploy/ with the challenges response
